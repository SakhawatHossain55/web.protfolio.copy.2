            <p>There are six seasons in our country. Winter is one of them. It is the season of mist and cold. So, winter morning is misty and cold. There is dense fog everywhere. Everything looks hazy. Things at a distance can hardly be seen. The tall trees are covered with fog and they cannot be made out. It dews at night.</p>
